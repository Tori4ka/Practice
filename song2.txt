I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my old life behind
Not a yes-sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, thunder
Thunder

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
